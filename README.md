Hereâ€™s a breakdown of your **Secure File Encryption & Sharing System (SFES)** project based on your updated requirements:

---

### **1. Project Overview:**

The **Secure File Encryption & Sharing System (SFES)** is designed to provide users with a simple yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt files without complex access control mechanisms. The primary objectives of the system are:

- **Confidentiality**: Encrypt files to ensure unauthorized users cannot access their contents.
- **Usability**: Provide a user-friendly GUI to encrypt, decrypt, and share files effortlessly.
- **File Sharing**: Allow users to securely share encrypted files.

The system should be lightweight, easy to install, and require minimal configuration.

#### **Expected Outcomes:**

- A simple, standalone application that enables users to encrypt and decrypt files easily.
- A secure method for sharing encrypted files.
- A user-friendly graphical interface for smooth operation.

#### **Scope:**

The system will include:

- A GUI-based interface for user interactions.
- File encryption and decryption functionalities.
- Secure file-sharing capabilities.

### **2. Module-Wise Breakdown:**

#### **Module 1: User Interface (UI)**

**Purpose**: Provide an intuitive graphical user interface for encrypting, decrypting, and sharing files.

**Roles**:

- Enable users to browse and select files for encryption/decryption.
- Provide buttons for encrypting, decrypting, and sharing files.
- Display status messages (e.g., "Encryption successful", "Decryption failed").

**Functionalities**:

- **File Selection**: Users can select files from their system.
- **Encryption & Decryption Controls**: Buttons to encrypt and decrypt files.
- **Sharing Mechanism**: Generate a secure encrypted file that can be sent to others.
- **Status & Notifications**: Provide feedback messages on encryption, decryption, and sharing actions.

---

#### **Module 2: Security & Encryption**

**Purpose**: Ensure strong encryption for files before they are stored or shared.

**Roles**:

- Encrypt files using a robust algorithm.
- Securely decrypt files upon request.
- Generate encryption keys automatically or allow user-defined keys.

**Functionalities**:

- **File Encryption**: Encrypt files using AES-256 encryption.
- **File Decryption**: Decrypt files with the correct key.
- **Key Management**: Provide options to generate, save, or input encryption keys.
- **Secure Hashing (Optional)**: Use hashing (SHA-256) to verify file integrity.

---

#### **Module 3: File Sharing**

**Purpose**: Enable users to share encrypted files securely.

**Roles**:

- Package encrypted files for easy transfer.
- Provide an option to generate a key file or a password-protected decryption mechanism.

**Functionalities**:

- **Export Encrypted File**: Save encrypted files in a sharable format.
- **Key Sharing**: Allow users to securely send decryption keys via a separate channel (e.g., QR code, email, or password-protected file).

---

### **3. Functionalities Breakdown:**

#### **Module 1: User Interface (UI)**

- **File Selection**: Select files for encryption/decryption.
- **Encryption & Decryption**: One-click encryption and decryption.
- **File Sharing**: Save encrypted files for sharing.
- **Status Messages**: Indicate success or failure of actions.

#### **Module 2: Security & Encryption**

- **AES-256 Encryption**: Encrypt files securely.
- **Decryption with Key**: Only users with the correct key can decrypt files.
- **Key Management**: Users can save or manually enter keys.
- **Hashing (Optional)**: Verify file integrity using SHA-256.

#### **Module 3: File Sharing**

- **Save Encrypted File**: Store encrypted files separately.
- **Secure Key Transfer**: Share decryption keys securely.
- **Custom Password Option**: Allow password-based decryption.

---

### **4. Technology Recommendations:**

- **Programming Language**: Python (for easy GUI and encryption)
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter (for simple UI) or PyQt (for advanced UI)
- **Encryption Library**: `PyCryptodome` (AES encryption)
- **Hashing**: `hashlib` (SHA-256 for integrity checks)
- **File Handling**: Standard Python file handling methods

---

### **5. Execution Plan:**

#### **Step 1: Build the GUI**

- Create a window with buttons for encryption, decryption, and file selection.

#### **Step 2: Implement File Encryption**

- Use AES-256 to encrypt files.
- Generate a key and allow users to save it.

#### **Step 3: Implement File Decryption**

- Decrypt files using the correct key.
- Provide an error message if the key is incorrect.

#### **Step 4: Develop File Sharing Mechanism**

- Allow users to save encrypted files separately.
- Provide key-sharing options.

#### **Step 5: Test & Optimize**

- Test encryption and decryption with various file types.
- Improve the UI for better usability.

#### **Step 6: Deployment**

- Package the application as an executable (`.exe` for Windows, `.app` for macOS).
- Distribute the application with minimal dependencies.
